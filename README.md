# Alien-Invasion
a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty.

## Pygame Installation
Pygame requires Python; if you don't already have it, you can download it from python.org. Use python 3.7.7 or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally runs faster.

The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
To see if it works, run one of the included examples:
```
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
```
For detail information about pygame installation, go to https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

## Run the game
```
python3 alien_invasion.py
```
